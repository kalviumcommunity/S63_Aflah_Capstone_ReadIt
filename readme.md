Problem Statement
In today's digital era, online communities play a significant role in social interaction and content sharing. Reddit is one of the most popular platforms where users can create, discuss, and vote on posts. However, there is a need for a custom Reddit-like platform where users can share text, links, and images, upvote/downvote posts, and engage in discussions with enhanced features such as better UI/UX, authentication, and post sorting.
Challenges:
Implementing user authentication (login/register) securely.
Building a scalable and efficient database structure.
Managing state efficiently using Redux.
Handling upvotes/downvotes with real-time updates.
Implementing image uploads for posts and avatars.
Ensuring responsive design across devices.
Implementing sorting and pagination for large amounts of posts.
 
Solution
Reddish is a full-stack web application that provides a platform where users can:
Register/Login securely using JWT-based authentication.
Create and manage posts (text, links, or images).
Comment on posts and engage in discussions.
Upvote/Downvote posts and comments.
Sort posts based on different algorithms (Hot, Top, New, Controversial).
Search posts using a full-text search feature.
Paginate posts for better performance.
Upload images (posts & profile avatars) using Cloudinary.
Enable dark mode toggle with local storage save.
Show toast notifications for user actions.
